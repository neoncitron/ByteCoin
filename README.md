# ByteCoin
A practice app from AppBrewery's iOS 13 &amp; Swift 5 course on Udemy. All rights go to Angela Yu and App Brewery.

This is an app that shows you the current exchange rate of Bitcoin from different currencies.

The API key has been hidden. To use your own API key, you need to create a Constants.swift file with a Constants struct that stores it.
